# Phaser
This is an application for a real-time phaser effect.

"ViewController.swift" is the main code for this project.

In order to run this application, download the zip file and open "finalphaser.xcodeproj"

In the menu bar, select "Product --> Run" or select the "Build and Run Current Scheme" button (looks like a play button) to build project. 

In the simulator, there are sliders to control:
1. Speed of LFO
2. Depth of LFO
3. Feedback

The "Phaser.pd" file is the Pure Data patch for the effect.
